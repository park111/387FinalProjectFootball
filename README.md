Recreates the handheld video game football 2. Here is a walmart page that describes the game and gives the image of what I will be attempting to replicate. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Football-Electronic-Game-Handheld-Mattel-Classic/43098492 
I am hoping to use an LCD screen, a speaker for sound FX, and buttons to control movement. There are also special buttons for kicking, checking the score, and checking staus of down, distance, and time left.
